        <p><em>Aspiring Web Developer, <a href="https://www.englishfirst.com/blog/authors/brendan-schatzki/#" target="blank">Language Trainer</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBtQ9HQ990E2k21RjmOMUfQ" target="blank">Lifelong
              Musician</a></em></p>
        <p>I am an aspiring web developer, currently learning the ins-and-outs of <strong>HTML, CSS. and JS</strong>. I'm hoping to be doing <em>steady freelance work</em> by the <strong>end of 2022</strong>, and to have a <em>full-time entry-level
            web developer position</em> by the <strong>spring of 2023</strong>. I have spent the last several years in China, where I was involved in language instruction and corporate training for international companies, including a prominent
          e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia. I am also an avid musician; I've done everything from opera, to a cappella, to pop music.</p>
